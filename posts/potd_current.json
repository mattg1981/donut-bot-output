                "selftext": "Hi EthTrader fam,\n\nDid you know that after the ZKFair airdrop there's also some farming going on for their number 1 DEX, Sideswap?\n\nWhile holders of ZKFair will automatically be eligible for their drop, the main bulk of $SIDE rewards will go to LP providers. There's also an easy way to farm points by connecting your Twitter and Discord account, which I will share on this post.\n\nSo let's get to the steps!\n\nStep 1: Go to the official site [sideswap.finance](https://sideswap.finance), and click on the 'airdrop' tab ([https://sideswap.finance/#/airdrop](https://sideswap.finance/#/airdrop))\n\n**Main task #1: Adding LP**\n\n[Screenshot on the page after adding LP](https://preview.redd.it/syk4tt5902cc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cd778bf0d5f8d7a7d5cad99f9ef4862832f5d50)\n\n**Step 1**: Swap some of your ZKFair to USDC on the Sideswap 'swap' page\n\n**Step 2**: On the 'Pool' tab on Sideswap, add ZKFair and USDC to the LP (which will be split 50-50). The airdrop tab should eventually update to show your estimated drop size (but may take some time to update)\n\n**Main task 2: Zealy quests** (after clicking on Zealy on Sideswap)\n\n[Same webpage as above](https://preview.redd.it/zbej3qr112cc1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2ea5e2da7e4d1f8cc943a4017b05238621b1ffc)\n\n**Step 1**: Click the 'Zealy' hyperlink. Login to a Zealy account using **wallet connect** and connect your metamask (same wallet with your ZKFair in it).\n\n**Step 2**: Click on 'Zealy' hyperlink on the Sideswap page to get to the exact Sideswap page. \n\n**Step 2:** Go to Sideswap questing page, click 'quests'. (Link: [https://zealy.io/c/sideswap-6411/questboard?view=general](https://zealy.io/c/sideswap-6411/questboard?view=general) ). You should see this and complete the quests to end points, which should be reflected on the Sideswap dashboard\n\nMain tasks: Connect twitter and discord account, connect email to mirror. So make sure you have your Twitter and Discord account logged in on the same browser.\n\n**Additional:** Note that if you have added LP, you can also claim additional points by showing screenshot as evidence (steps are on the Zealy page)\n\n**Note**: If you trade ZKF on Sideswap, that will add to your points as well.\n\n**Extra: Stake ZKFair (potential dual farming for more $ZKF and $Side here)**\n\nClick the 'learn more' tab on ZKF stakers as you see on the above screenshot. Read the docs [https://docs.zkfair.io/economic-model/stake-zkf](https://docs.zkfair.io/economic-model/stake-zkf) to learn more of the full steps and make your decision if it is worth farming or not.\n\nNote there's also a **part 2 ZKFair gas fee drop** for **ZKF stakers** by the official ZKFair team. (this is aside from farming $SIDE points). This will be based on time spent vs amount staked.\n\n I have found it disproportionately rewards those with high lock-up time of up to 2 years (a small amount staked for 2 years could earn you more points than a large amount staked for 1 week/month for example, so make your choice on that).\n\nSo that's it folks! ZKFair free money is now rewarding us with more $SIDE free money. While I only see the SIDESWAP as ZKFair's side chick and am not expecting the value of the drop to be big, l still see it as a nice **little bonus** \\- especially when I'm **already taking profits by selling $ZKF pumps** on Sideswap and am **adding LP** to cover gas fees! If you're not selling any ZKF, you can just take a minute to connect your Twitter and Discord account to see if you get anything from the points as well.\n\nHappy farming!"

The last occurrence of this event took place **four** **years ago**. The current setup is highly favorable, marking a strong bullish sign.\n\nSource:\n\n* [Tweet](https://x.com/StockmoneyL/status/1745769600535454008?s=20)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0jaerok91cc1.jpg?width=1377&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8bcbee3baec82572041b5ee83df726e19b3d87\n\n>The crunch question remains: can ETH outperform Bitcoin? This what we are looking for, when we buy altcoins. On the ETHBTC chart, the price had been following an uptrend for six years. However, this trendline was recently broken.\n\nSource:\n\n* [Tweet](https://x.com/StockmoneyL/status/1745769603878309978?s=20)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wlet6cm91cc1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfdd32d0269a1f385e28245d0a7fc11c8e7fd995\n\n>We all witnessed the approval of Bitcoin ETFs live on X. Almost **5 Billion in trading volume** on the first day of trading. The upside is significantly higher for Ethereum if approved, with a decision expected in the summer. Until then, the market will follow this narrative of anticipation for the Ethereum ETF approval. And you all know, what that means \ud83d\ude80\n\nSource:\n\n* [Tweet](https://x.com/StockmoneyL/status/1745769606705299502?s=20)\n\n# Personal Opinion and Analysis\n\n2024 first half looks really promising. We have just achieved a huge milestone with BTC Spot ETFs and the market is already looking for the next big thing, ETH Spot ETFs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7ud95en91cc1.jpg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fec10c28eaf1c624e962a3ba85abbe36aaabc8a3\n\nAs we can see, VanEck's ETH Spot ETF final deadline is on May 23 2024 but we will probably have more companies like BlackRock trying to have their own ETF too.\n\nImportant Events in the following months:\n\n* Ethereum's Dencun Upgrade: January 17, 2024\n* BTC halving: April 19, 2024\n* VanEck's ETH Spot ETF final deadline: May 23, 2024\n\nIf all this news are not enough for you to be bullish and smile the whole day I don't know what else you need.\n\nNo matter what happens in the short term, the future is bright and crypto is inevitable."
